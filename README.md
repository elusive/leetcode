# Practice w/Leetcode Problems

### Learning...
I am always trying to either learn something new or retain
what I already know and I thought I should start collecting
all of my efforts in a single repository so that it could
be referred back to later.

### Leetcode?
I have done problems on several sites. Starting long ago with
[Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net), and continuing
at sites like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) and 
[Code Signal](https://app.codesignal.com/profile/elusive). 
However I see so many leetcode repositories on github that I 
figured I could do it also. I also have a lot of code on the
coding site [REPL.it](https://replit.com/@elusive). 

### Languages
I will be using several languages. All of which are ones I am 
trying to either learn as new or get better at. For starters I 
will be using [Go](https://go.dev) as I have been learning it
lately and am using it for a small CLI utility I am writing at
work. I will also be using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
as I plan to be using it at work also eventually. Lastly I am 
trying to get comfortable with [C++](https://cplusplus.com/).
